# Task ID: 8
# Title: Frontend Project Structure and Core Components Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the existing frontend project structure and core UI components using React and Material-UI, focusing on reusability, state management, error handling, accessibility, and testing.
# Details:
The frontend project structure and core components are already implemented. This task focuses on optimization in the following areas:

1. Refactor existing components for better reusability and maintainability
2. Implement proper state management patterns using React hooks and context
3. Add comprehensive error handling in UI components (error boundaries, fallback UIs, user-friendly error messages)
4. Improve accessibility compliance (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
5. Add internationalization support for multi-language capability
6. Set up component testing infrastructure using React Testing Library

The optimization should maintain the existing Material-UI theme while enhancing component performance and user experience.

# Test Strategy:
1. Set up and expand component tests using React Testing Library
2. Create test cases for error handling scenarios in components
3. Verify accessibility compliance using automated tools and manual testing
4. Test internationalization functionality with multiple languages
5. Verify state management patterns work correctly across component hierarchies
6. Ensure refactored components maintain backward compatibility
