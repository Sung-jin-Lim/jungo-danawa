# Task ID: 3
# Title: Core Backend API Structure Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the existing RESTful API structure for the backend, including routes, controllers, and middleware.
# Details:
Optimize Express.js server with improved middleware configuration (CORS, body-parser, etc.). Refine API route structure for search, product details, comparison, and platform operations. Enhance controller logic for each route for better performance. Strengthen error handling middleware. Improve request validation. Optimize rate limiting and request throttling. Enhance logging system for API requests. Refine API endpoints following RESTful principles.

# Test Strategy:
Expand API tests using Jest and Supertest. Verify all endpoints return correct status codes and data formats with improved response times. Test enhanced error handling scenarios. Validate optimized rate limiting functionality.
