# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Development Environment Configuration Refinement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refine the development environment and configuration for both frontend and backend components, building upon the completed project setup.
# Details:
With the basic project structure already in place, focus on environment refinement through the following activities:

1. Add Docker configuration files for both development and production environments to enable easier development and deployment
2. Implement proper environment variables management system with .env files and documentation
3. Set up and configure linting (ESLint) and code formatting tools (Prettier) with appropriate rules for the project
4. Create comprehensive documentation covering:
   - Development environment setup instructions
   - Available scripts and commands
   - Environment variables reference
   - Docker usage guidelines
   - Coding standards and conventions

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker containers build and run correctly in both development and production modes. Test environment variables are properly loaded in different environments. Confirm linting and formatting tools work as expected with the defined rules. Review documentation for completeness and clarity by having a team member follow the instructions to set up their environment.
