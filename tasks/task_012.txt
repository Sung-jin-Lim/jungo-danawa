# Title: Deal Rating System Algorithm Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the existing algorithm for rating deals based on condition, price, and market value.
# Details:
Refine the algorithm to calculate deal ratings with more accurate consideration of product condition, price relative to market value, and platform reliability. Optimize scoring system with clearer thresholds for different rating levels. Enhance explanation generation for rating factors. Improve visual indicators for exceptional offers. Optimize caching for rating calculations. Refine the algorithm to be more precisely adjustable based on product categories.

# Test Strategy:
Test enhanced rating algorithm with various product scenarios. Verify ratings align better with expected values. Test improved explanation generation. Validate optimized caching functionality. Test with more edge cases (extremely low/high prices).
