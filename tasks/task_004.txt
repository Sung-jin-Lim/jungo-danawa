# Task ID: 4
# Title: Web Scraping System Enhancement for Danggeun Market
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the existing scraping system for Danggeun Market with improved image extraction and error handling.
# Details:
The Danggeun Market scraper is already implemented but requires optimization in several key areas. Focus on fixing the image URL extraction which currently has an 80% failure rate. Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms to improve scraping reliability. Implement more efficient page navigation and data extraction techniques to reduce scraping time. Add comprehensive logging for debugging problematic scrapes and identifying patterns in failures. Optimize performance by implementing selective resource loading to reduce bandwidth usage and improve speed. Maintain the existing search functionality and data normalization while improving their efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Test image URL extraction improvements against known problematic listings to verify reduction in failure rate. Validate error handling by simulating common failure scenarios. Measure performance improvements in page navigation and data extraction speed. Verify logging functionality captures sufficient detail for debugging. Test selective resource loading to confirm it doesn't affect data quality while improving performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Image URL Extraction Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Redesign the image extraction mechanism to address the 80% failure rate by implementing robust selector patterns and fallback mechanisms.
### Details:
1. Analyze current image extraction code to identify failure points.
2. Implement multiple selector strategies (XPath, CSS selectors) to target image elements.
3. Add fallback mechanisms that try alternative DOM traversal approaches when primary selectors fail.
4. Implement image URL validation to ensure extracted URLs are properly formatted.
5. Create a test suite with sample pages containing various image layouts.
6. Test the solution against at least 50 different product listings to verify improvement.
7. Measure and document the new success rate, aiming for >95% successful extractions.

## 2. Implement Robust Error Handling and Recovery System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive error handling framework with automatic retry mechanisms and graceful degradation for the scraper.
### Details:
1. Create a centralized error handling module that categorizes errors (network, parsing, authentication).
2. Implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
3. Add session recovery mechanisms to handle authentication timeouts.
4. Develop graceful degradation strategies to continue scraping with partial data when non-critical elements fail.
5. Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent excessive retries during systemic failures.
6. Create error recovery state persistence to resume scraping after crashes.
7. Test with simulated error conditions (network drops, malformed HTML, rate limiting).
8. Measure and document improvement in scraping completion rates.

## 3. Optimize Page Navigation and Data Extraction [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Refactor the navigation and extraction logic to reduce page load times and improve scraping efficiency.
### Details:
1. Implement parallel processing for independent page scraping tasks.
2. Add intelligent throttling to prevent detection while maximizing throughput.
3. Optimize CSS/XPath selectors for faster DOM traversal.
4. Implement a caching layer for repeated page elements and templates.
5. Refactor the page navigation logic to minimize unnecessary page loads.
6. Add early termination for pages without relevant data.
7. Implement incremental data extraction to process data as it becomes available.
8. Benchmark and document performance improvements, targeting at least 30% reduction in total scraping time.

## 4. Implement Comprehensive Logging System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Develop a structured logging framework that captures detailed information about the scraping process for debugging and analysis.
### Details:
1. Design a hierarchical logging structure with configurable verbosity levels.
2. Implement context-aware logging that tracks the scraping process across pages.
3. Add detailed logging for critical operations (image extraction, navigation, error recovery).
4. Implement performance metrics logging (time per page, extraction success rates).
5. Create a log aggregation and analysis module to identify patterns in failures.
6. Add visual indicators in logs for quick identification of critical issues.
7. Implement log rotation and archiving to manage log file sizes.
8. Create a dashboard or reporting tool to visualize scraping performance and failure patterns.

## 5. Implement Selective Resource Loading [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Optimize bandwidth usage by implementing selective loading of resources based on scraping requirements.
### Details:
1. Configure the scraper to disable loading of unnecessary resources (CSS, fonts, analytics scripts).
2. Implement request filtering to only load images that will be processed.
3. Add lazy loading capabilities to defer resource loading until needed.
4. Implement a resource prioritization system based on scraping requirements.
5. Create a bandwidth monitoring system to track and optimize data usage.
6. Add configurable resource loading profiles for different scraping scenarios.
7. Implement caching for frequently accessed resources.
8. Benchmark and document bandwidth savings and performance improvements, targeting at least 40% reduction in bandwidth usage.
