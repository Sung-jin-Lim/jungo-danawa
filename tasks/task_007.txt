# Task ID: 7
# Title: Data Processing and Normalization Pipeline Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the existing pipeline for processing, normalizing, and categorizing product data from all sources.
# Details:
Refine the unified data processing pipeline that handles data from all platforms. Optimize price parsing and normalization across currencies and formats. Enhance product categorization algorithms for better accuracy. Improve image URL processing and standardization. Refine duplicate detection and merging logic. Enhance data enrichment capabilities (e.g., extracting specifications from descriptions). Optimize the pipeline for better extensibility for future platforms.

# Test Strategy:
Test with expanded sample data from all platforms. Verify improved normalization accuracy for different product types. Test enhanced duplicate detection with similar products. Validate improved categorization accuracy.
