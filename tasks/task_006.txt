# Task ID: 6
# Title: Coupang API Integration Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the existing Coupang scraping implementation for better performance and reliability.
# Details:
Enhance the existing Coupang scraping implementation with improved proxy support. Develop a robust proxy rotation system to ensure reliable scraping operations. Implement advanced request throttling and retry mechanisms to avoid detection. Improve handling of Coupang's anti-scraping measures through techniques like varying user agents, request patterns, and session management. Add comprehensive fallback mechanisms for when scraping attempts fail, including alternative scraping paths and data sources. Optimize the data extraction process to more efficiently parse and transform Coupang product data into the standardized product schema.

# Test Strategy:
Test the enhanced proxy rotation system with various Coupang product pages. Verify the effectiveness of throttling and retry mechanisms under different load conditions. Validate the system's ability to handle anti-scraping measures. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating scraping failures. Measure performance improvements in the data extraction process compared to the current implementation.
