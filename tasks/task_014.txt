# Task ID: 14
# Title: Caching and Performance Optimization Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance existing caching mechanisms and further optimize performance for both frontend and backend with advanced strategies.
# Details:
Implement Redis for server-side caching of scraping results to reduce redundant operations. Develop proper cache invalidation strategies to ensure data freshness while maintaining performance. Optimize database queries with refined indexing and query structure analysis. Implement frontend performance optimizations including code splitting and lazy loading for components and images. Add monitoring tools and metrics to identify and address performance bottlenecks. Enhance browser caching for static assets. Optimize API response sizes and implement compression for API responses. Improve server-side rendering or static generation for key pages.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance before and after optimizations using established metrics. Test Redis cache hit rates and response time improvements for scraped data. Verify cache invalidation strategies maintain data integrity. Benchmark database query performance improvements. Measure frontend load times and bundle sizes across different network conditions. Validate monitoring tools correctly identify performance issues. Document performance gains with quantitative metrics.
